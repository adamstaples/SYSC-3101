;Show that the gcd method is iterative and not recursive using the subsititution model.

;Returns the greatest common denomintor on two numbers
(define (greatestcd a b)
 (if (= b 0)
 a
 (greatestcd b (remainder a b))))

;(greatestcd 279 15)
;(greatestcd 15 9)))
;(greatestcd 9 6)))
;(greatestcd 6 3))))
;(greatestcd 3 0)))

; this shows that the gcd process is not recursive as each step relies on a number passed by the last call
; and it does not rely on a base case to calculate anything
