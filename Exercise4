;Assignment 1 SYSC 3101
;Author: Adam Staples
;Exercice 4
;use increment and decrement only to complete the functions

; iterate a number
(define (increment a)
  (+ a 1))

; decrement a number
(define (decrement a)
  (- a 1))

;add two numbers assuming that a is negative
(define (add% a b)
(if (= a 0) b
(add% (increment a) (decrement b))))

;add two numbers together assuming that b is a negative number
(define (add-negative a b)
  (if (= a 0) b
 (add-negative (decrement a) (increment b))))

;sum any two integers together
(define (sum-of-integers a b)
  (cond
    [(< a 0) (add% a b)]
     
    [else (add-negative a b)]))

;(sum-of-integers 2 3)
;(add-negative 2 3)
;(add-negative 1 4)
;(add-negative 0 5)
;5
;Uses same as type of method as the previous exercise part 2, as such it is not iterative
